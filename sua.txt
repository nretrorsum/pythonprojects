2. 'Support the Ukrainian Army'
History
The charitable foundation 'Support the Ukrainian Army' was established in April 2014 to provide humanitarian aid to Ukrainian military personnel who are resisting Russian aggression following the annexation of Crimea and the onset of active hostilities in eastern Ukraine.
Since the full-scale invasion of peaceful Ukraine by the Russian Federation, 'Support the Ukrainian Army' has been actively supporting the soldiers of the Armed Forces of Ukraine and territorial defense.
Today, they are defending not only our state but also true humanistic values and guarding the peace of all Europe.
Half of our team is currently on the front lines within the ranks of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, defending our people, our freedom, and our right to live on our own land.
The other half of our team continues to provide maximum support to our defenders. And we will fight, each in our own place, until our assured Victory.
