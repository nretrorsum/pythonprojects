History
The humanistic movement UAnimals was created in 2016 by public activist Oleksandr Todorchuk and began its activities with a large-scale fight against the exploitation of animals in circuses.
Scope of Movement
Since the start of the full-scale war, we have been actively helping animals from the combat zones by providing evacuation, food, and medicines for shelters.

As of November 2023, our sterilization vehicle travels to villages and towns in frontline regions to sterilize animals there.
During the existence of UAnimals, we managed to initiate the largest animal rights march in Eastern Europe, which takes place simultaneously in 30 cities and gathers tens of thousands of concerned Ukrainians every year.
A few years ago, we began collaborating with Ukrainian clothing brands and introduced the Cruelty-Free Fashion nomination in Ukraine's main fashion award, the Best Fashion Awards, to recognize the most ethical designers.
